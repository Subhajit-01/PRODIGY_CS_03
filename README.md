# Password Complexity Checker

The **Password Complexity Checker** is a lightweight tool that evaluates the strength of user passwords. Whether you're a developer, security enthusiast, or just curious about password security, this project provides valuable insights.

## Features

- **Length Assessment**: The checker analyzes password length and assigns a score based on predefined criteria. Longer passwords receive higher scores.
- **Character Variety**: It checks for the presence of different character types:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Special characters (e.g., symbols, punctuation)
  - Digits (numbers)
- **Hackable Password Detection**: Cross-references user passwords with a list of known hackable passwords. If a password appears in the list, the score is set to zero.
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: Provides clear feedback on password complexity and suggests improvements.
